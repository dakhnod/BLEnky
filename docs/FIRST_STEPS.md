# First steps

Right, so you got a shiny new board.
Chances are there is a freshly baked preconfigured firmware waiting just for you.
Just check the pictures if anything looks like your board and click on it.
After flashing your file feel free to re-configure BLEnky using the section at the bottom of the page.

If you don't find your board here, try looking through the [latest release](https://github.com/dakhnod/BLEnky/releases/latest) for a package that sounds like your board.
If your board shows up as a drive and says something about UF2, follow [these instructions](boards/GENERIC_UF2.md).
If it just shows up as a Serial port, it likely has the nordic bootloader installed, go with [this](boards/NORDIC_DFU.md).
If it doesn't show up at all, follow [this](boards/GENERIC.md).
