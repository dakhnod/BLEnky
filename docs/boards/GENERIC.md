# Generic board / without bootloader

If your board does not appear to have a bootloader at all, get the hex file for your board, or the generic hex file.
Then follow [these instruction](FLASHING.md).

Once the firmware is copied/flashed, the flash drive will disappear and you should be able to head to https://ble.nullco.de and connect to your board. You just saved yourself years of development!
